# Data Analysis using R
Course project to analyze and clean a dataset using R in Coursera
## Introduction
This project is an analysis of the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" downloaded from the https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The description of the dataset can be found here - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
## Description
There are two datasets - train and test data. These contain the acceleration and gyroscope measurements(namely signal values, mean, std, mag etc). The goal of the analysis is to merge these datasets, extarct only the mean and std measurements, tidy the extracted data and summarize the mean for each measurement.
## Notes
Please read the readme.txt, features_info.txt from teh downloaded dataset before going through the code. 
##### Please read the CodeBook.md file to understand the variable names, code logic & sequence and dimensions of the resulting data frame
